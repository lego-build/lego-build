## Overview

Lego-build is a command-line tool that speeds up front-end development workflow by minimizing boilerplate code. Components, pages, reducers, actions, hooks, and whatever specific 'blocks' your app is comprised of may all be created in one line.

## Quick setup

You can install lego-build globally from npm:

```
npm i @ogteam/lego-build -g
```

<br />
Then, for example, you can rapidly construct a component (Nav) by running:

```
lego-build component Nav
```

However, lego-build does more than merely generate 'components.' It's far more adaptable and strong than that.

## Documentation
Check out our [docs site](https://lego-build.github.io/docs) for thorough (and easy-to-understand) documentation on how to configure lego-build.

## Features ‚≠ê

Other CLI tools make it simple to create components. But Lego-building is a very different story. It:

- is readily customizable.
- It may be applied to any front-end framework.
It has a large [developer community](https://lego-build.github.io/community) and the procedures they use to set up lego-build.
- features shorter CLI commands to save you even more time.
- Allows you to construct whatever 'block' your program is made up of, not simply components.
