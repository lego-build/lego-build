## Overview

Lego-build is a CLI tool that helps speed up front-end development workflow by reducing the amount of boilerplate code you write. You can easily create components, pages, reducers, actions, hooks or any special 'blocks' your app is made of ‚Äî in one line.

## Quick setup

You can install lego-build globally from npm:

```
npm i @ogteam/lego-build -g
```

<br />
Then you can quickly create a component (Nav for instance) by running:

```
lego-build component Nav
```

But lego-build does more than just create 'components'. It's far more flexible and powerful than that.

## Documentation

For detailed (and easy to understand) documentation on how to configure lego-build, check out our [docs site](https://lego-build.github.io/docs).

## Features ‚≠ê

There are other CLI tools that help you make React components easily. But lego-build is far different. It:

- is easily configurable.
- can be used for any front-end framework.
- has a vast [community of developers](https://lego-build.github.io/community) and the workflows they use to setup lego-build.
- has shorter CLI commands to save your precious time even more.
- enables you create any 'block' your app is composed of, not just components.

## Contributing

We are open to any ideas you may have to make the tool better. Just open a new issue to tell us your idea for a new feature. For bug fixes (though we're sure there'll be none üòå) fork the repo and send in a pull request.

We're on a mission to make front-end development **fun** again!
