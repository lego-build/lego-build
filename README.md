## Overview

Lego-build is a command-line tool that speeds up front-end development workflow by minimizing boilerplate code. You can easily create components, pages, reducers, actions, hooks or any special 'blocks' your app is made of — in one line.

## Quick setup

You can install lego-build globally from npm:

```
npm i @ogteam/lego-build -g
```

<br />
Then you can quickly create a component (Nav for instance) by running:

```
lego-build component Nav
```

However, lego-build does more than merely generate 'components.' It's far more flexible and powerful than that.

## Documentation

Check out our [docs site](https://lego-build.github.io/docs) for thorough (and easy-to-understand) documentation on how to configure lego-build.

## Features ⭐

There are other CLI tools that help you make React components easily. But lego-build is far different. It:

- is readily customizable.
- may be applied to any front-end framework.
- has a vast [developer community](https://lego-build.github.io/community) and the workflows they use to set up lego-build.
- has shorter CLI commands to save you even more time.
- allows you to create whatever 'block' your app is made up of, not just components.
