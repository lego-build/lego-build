            <p>
              Lego-build is a CLI tool that makes it super easy to perform
              routine tasks like creating components, pages, hooks etc, in your
              web application. It is flexible and easy to configure,
              prioritizing great developer experience.

              Installation
            </Heading>
            <p>To get started, install lego-build from npm globally.</p>
            <Terminal>npm i @ogteam/lego-build -g</Terminal>

            <p>
              To quickly setup a component (Nav for instance), run the following
              command.
            </p>
            <Terminal>lego-build component Nav</Terminal>
            <p>
              But lego-build can do much more than make 'components'. Its beauty
              lies in flexibility.

              While React is unopinionated, and every developer structures their
              front-end app differently, every app is made up of special files
              and folders we call{" "}
              <a href="#blocks" className={style.internal_link}>
                blocks
              </a>
              . These blocks could be components, pages, reducers, actions,
              hooks, and so much more. Lego-build allows us easily to configure
              (and mould ðŸ¤“) the blocks we'll be using in our application,
              inside a{" "}
              <a href="#json-structure" className={style.internal_link}>
                lego.json
              </a>{" "}
              file. Before we look at the overall structure of the JSON file,
              let's first model a React block as a JSON object.
